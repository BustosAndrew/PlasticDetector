# PlasticDetector
Made during a two-day hackathon at HackDavis 2023, working with three others to make a Flutter mobile app.<br/>
This is a backend repo written entirely in Python/Django, using [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/) for object detection within images.
Darkent was utilized to detect recycable materials such as plastic and glass bottles, and return an image showing the highlighted objects that match said criteria.

Main code is below:
